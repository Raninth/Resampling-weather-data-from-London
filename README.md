# Resampling-weather-data-from-London
## The Task
The task involves loading and structuring weather data from 2000 onwards, focusing on specific features like precipitation, mean temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and snow depth. Thoughtfully imputing missing values is crucial for accurate analysis. Subsequently, the analysis addresses two questions with visualizations: identifying the month with the highest precipitation between 2000 and 2010 and determining the coolest average temperature year between 2000 and 2020. The goal is to provide actionable insights through visual representations, aiding stakeholders in understanding and making informed decisions based on historical weather data.
